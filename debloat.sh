#Working assumption is that user is a grown-up who can manually install their own packages as needed. Prior to such action, said big-boy user would prefer a harddrive which is not as cluttered by useless packages. 
#It is a wortwhile act, in principle, to remove unnecessary packages from a system so as to limit the number of packages for which there could exist undisclosed vulnerabilities.
#If you later find a desired package is missing, install it manually.

#Removes language packs != english
